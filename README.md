# CrowdFundProphetApp
**Crowdfunding Predictor App with Machine Learning**

This application leverages an advanced **machine learning model**, specifically a **stacked classifier designed for binary classification**, which was developed as part of my [CrowdOfferingsStudy](https://github.com/apsinghAnalytics/CrowdOfferingsStudy) project. This model forms the core of the application's analytical capabilities, enabling it to deliver insightful predictions with about **80% accuracy**.

The instructions for the deployment of this **streamlit app** are very similar to that previously listed in the readme of my other [streamlit app project](https://github.com/apsinghAnalytics/streamlit_VentureGen) with the following readme:
